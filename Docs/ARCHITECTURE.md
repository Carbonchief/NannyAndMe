# Architecture Overview

## SwiftData model graph

The app persists all user state with SwiftData models that mirror directly to CloudKit:

- `Profile` (`ProfileActionStateModel` alias) is the root entity. It owns profile metadata and an ordered collection of `BabyAction` objects.
- `BabyAction` (`BabyActionModel` alias) represents an individual sleep/feeding/diaper event. Each action keeps a stable `UUID` identifier and timestamps normalized to UTC.

Relationships use SwiftData's inverse tracking so that deleting a profile cascades to its actions while individual actions can safely be re-parented. Each model stores a defaulted `UUID` identifier so CloudKit mirroring can restore stable identities without relying on SwiftData's unique-constraint attribute, which CloudKit mirroring does not support.

## Model container configuration

`AppDataStack.makeModelContainer` constructs the shared `ModelContainer` for `Profile` and `BabyAction`. When CloudKit sync is
enabled the `ModelConfiguration` attaches to the container `iCloud.com.prioritybit.nannyandme`, otherwise it falls back to a
purely local store (used for previews, tests, and the bootstrap placeholder container) to avoid registering multiple CloudKit
mirroring delegates for the same store.

## CloudKit mirroring lifecycle

`SyncStatusViewModel` consumes an async event stream sourced from either the real `CloudKitSyncMonitor` SPI (when the toolchain exposes it) or a fallback `CloudKitSyncMonitorCompat` shim that synthesizes a final idle event. The view model publishes a `State` enum that drives:

- A non-blocking sync message anchored to the bottom of `HomeView` during first-run imports.
- Status indicators in the new debug diagnostics panel.
- Force-refresh and timeout handling for manual sync attempts.

Remote notifications are funneled through `SyncCoordinator`, which still prepares CloudKit database subscriptions and triggers additional fetches when APNs wake the app. The coordinator and status view model share the main `ModelContext` so updates are reflected immediately.

## Sharing flow

`CloudKitSharingManager` provisions shares by talking directly to CloudKit. It looks for previously cached `CKShare` identifiers, fetches the associated records when possible, and falls back to creating a new share with `CKShare(rootRecord:)`. The manager persists share metadata via `ShareMetadataStore` so future lookups avoid redundant network work. Participant mutations reuse the stored record identifiers and send targeted `CKModifyRecordsOperation` updates, while stop-sharing tears down the share record and its custom zone. Every profile lives in a dedicated zone named `profile-<UUID>` that contains one `CD_Profile` root record plus `CD_BabyAction` children. `CloudKitRecordMapper` keeps the CloudKit payload in sync with SwiftData models, and `AppDataStack` schedules a background export after each save so shared zones remain current.

`ShareProfilePageViewModel` asks the manager for the share and presents participants via the standard `CKShare` interface. Updates, removals, and stop-sharing requests flow through the same manager so the UI reacts as soon as CloudKit confirms the change. Since SwiftData mirrors shared zones, collaborators see updates without custom fetch logic.

## Debug tooling

Under `#if DEBUG`, `SyncDiagnosticsView` combines information from `SyncCoordinator`, `SyncStatusViewModel`, and the CloudKit container. Developers can:

- Inspect account status, last push, and last successful sync.
- Review the current CloudKit monitor phase and model progress.
- Review shared zones, cached change tokens, and subscription identifiers, and trigger a manual shared-zone fetch for debugging.
- Trigger a manual sync or dump record counts for the private and shared databases.

The view is accessible from Settings â†’ Debug and complements the inline footer that end users see during long imports.
